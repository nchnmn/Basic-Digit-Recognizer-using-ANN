# README
This project implements a basic digit recognizer using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained to identify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Data Source:

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. The data is sourced from the Kaggle competition: 
MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer.

* Training data: `train.csv`
* Test data: `test.csv`

## Project Goals:

* Train a multi-layer ANN to recognize handwritten digits.
* Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* Achieve a satisfactory accuracy level in digit classification.

## Dependencies:
This project requires several Python libraries for its functionality. Please ensure you have the following installed:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
* tensorflow/keras
* sklearn
